# Abstract 
Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) are intestinal pathogens affecting over a billion people worldwide. STH control relies on microsopy-based diagnostics to monitor parasite prevalence and enable post-treatment surveillance, however, molecular diagnostics are rapidly being developed due to increased sensitivity, particularly in low-STH-prevalence settings. The genetic diversity of helminths and its potential impact on molecular diagnostics remains unclear. Using low-coverage genome sequencing, we assessed the presence of STHs in worm, faecal and purified egg samples from 27 countries, identifying differences in the genetic connectivity and diversity of STH-positive samples across regions and cryptic diversity between closely related human- and pig-infective species. We defined substancial copy number and sequence variants in current diagnostic targets and validated the impact of genetic variants on qPCR diagnostics using in vitro assays. Our study provides insights into the diversity and genomic epidemiology of STHs, highlighting challenges and opportunities for developing molecular diagnostics needed to support STH control efforts.
